# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for building a machine learning model to predict diabetes. The project involves:

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships
- Feature selection using statistical tests
- Data scaling and splitting into training and testing sets
- Training and evaluating multiple classification models (Gradient Boosting, SVM, Neural Network)
- Comparing model performance using metrics like F1-score and AUC-ROC
- Identifying key features influencing the predictions
- Providing actionable insights for healthcare professionals

## Dataset

The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The dataset contains diagnostic measurements for several female patients.

*(You can add a link to the dataset if it's publicly available)*

## Files in this Repository

- `diabetes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset file used in the project.
